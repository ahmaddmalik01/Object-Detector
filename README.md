The Object Detector Project is an object detection system built using PyTorch and related libraries, designed to detect and classify objects in images. It leverages the SSD300 model architecture for accurate detection. The project utilizes various Python libraries, including torchvision for pre-trained models, Pillow for image processing, tqdm for progress tracking, PrettyPrinter for improved data output formatting, and xmltodict for parsing XML data, particularly useful for datasets like Pascal VOC. To get started, install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file, and use the provided scripts for training the model and detecting objects in images.
